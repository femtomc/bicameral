## Architectural Refactoring Needed

### Complete Interaction Model
The current system only tracks individual actions, missing the complete user interaction flow. We need to refactor to capture:
- **User Query**: The actual natural language request
- **AI Interpretation**: What the AI understood
- **Action Sequence**: Uninterrupted sequence of actions taken
- **User Feedback**: Response to the complete action sequence

This will enable:
1. Learning user language patterns and preferences
2. Intent-to-action mapping
3. Success/failure pattern detection
4. Personalized language understanding
5. Better correction learning
