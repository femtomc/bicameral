# AI Memory System MVP

## What We've Built

A practical implementation framework for giving Claude Code persistent memory and learning capabilities. This allows Claude to:

1. **Remember** interactions across sessions
2. **Learn** project patterns automatically
3. **Accept** developer feedback
4. **Improve** effectiveness over time

## Key Components

### 1. Architecture Overview (`ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- Hierarchical memory system (Active â†’ Working â†’ Episodic â†’ Semantic)
- Hook-based integration with Claude Code
- Local SQLite storage for privacy
- Pattern detection and feedback processing

### 2. Implementation Plan (`IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`)
- Weekend MVP with basic logging and pattern detection
- Simple feedback commands: `ai-feedback correct/prefer/pattern`
- Auto-generated context in `CLAUDE.md`
- Practical Python scripts using only standard libraries

### 3. Developer Experience (`DEVELOPER_FEEDBACK_GUIDE.md`)
- Natural feedback during work: "use async/await here"
- Inline code comments: `@ai-pattern`, `@ai-preference`
- Query learned knowledge: `ai-memory show-patterns`
- Team knowledge sharing via export/import

### 4. Quick Setup (`setup-ai-memory.sh`)
```bash
# One command to get started
./setup-ai-memory.sh

# Then provide feedback as you work
ai-feedback prefer "use TypeScript strict mode"
ai-feedback pattern "always run tests before commit"
```

## How It Works

### During Development
```
Developer: "Help me fix the auth bug"
  â†“
Claude reads files (hooks log this)
  â†“
Pattern detector notices auth file access
  â†“
Next time: "Working on auth? Check auth.service.ts first"
```

### Feedback Loop
```
Developer notices mistake
  â†“
ai-feedback correct "use bcrypt not sha256"
  â†“
Preference stored in database
  â†“
Next time: Claude suggests bcrypt
```

### Pattern Learning
```
Multiple similar workflows detected
  â†“
Pattern crystallized: "API changes â†’ Update tests â†’ Update docs"
  â†“
Claude proactively suggests: "Don't forget to update tests"
```

## MVP Features

### Phase 1: Basic Memory (Weekend Project)
- âœ… Log all file operations
- âœ… Simple pattern detection
- âœ… Feedback commands
- âœ… Auto-update CLAUDE.md

### Phase 2: Smart Patterns (Week 2)
- ðŸ”„ Workflow detection
- ðŸ”„ Confidence scoring
- ðŸ”„ Context injection

### Phase 3: Advanced Learning (Week 3+)
- ðŸ“‹ Semantic search
- ðŸ“‹ Proactive suggestions
- ðŸ“‹ Team knowledge sharing

## Why This Approach Works

1. **Low Friction**: Hooks run automatically, no manual context management
2. **Developer Control**: Explicit feedback when needed, automatic learning otherwise
3. **Privacy First**: All data stays in project directory
4. **Incremental Value**: Start simple, add features as needed

## Key Insights from Research

Our framework applies these principles from the analyzed papers:

1. **Dynamic Model Construction** (MSA paper): Build project-specific models on-demand
2. **Hybrid Architecture**: Combine Claude's language understanding with structured memory
3. **Resource-Rational**: Only store and retrieve what's relevant
4. **Human-Centric**: Learn from developer feedback and preferences

## Next Steps

1. **Run Setup**: `./setup-ai-memory.sh`
2. **Configure Claude Code**: Add hook paths to settings
3. **Start Working**: Use Claude normally, it learns automatically
4. **Provide Feedback**: Correct mistakes, set preferences
5. **Check Progress**: `ai-memory show-patterns`

## Vision

Transform Claude Code from a stateless assistant into a true collaborator that:
- Understands your specific codebase
- Remembers your preferences
- Learns from every interaction
- Gets better over time

The MVP is just the beginning. With this foundation, we can build increasingly sophisticated learning and adaptation capabilities while maintaining developer control and privacy.
